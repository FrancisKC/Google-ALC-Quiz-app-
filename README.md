This is a Quiz App
The Google/ALC Quiz app is my udacity/andela project app that contains four questions using checkboxes,edit text field and radio buttons as
an answer paramter.
My app has the following features:
1. Made of four questions
2. Each correct answer gives the user 1 as score or -1 for each wrong answer.
3. The User can always check his/her last score in a seperate activity
4. It also doesnt allow the user to manipulate answered questions after hitting the "Submit"
5. It also has a button that rests the quiz.
